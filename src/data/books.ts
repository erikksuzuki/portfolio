      'The Perennial Philosophy: An Interpretation of the Great Mystics, East and West',
    author: 'Aldous Huxley',
    year: '1945',
    description: `"The Perennial Philosophy," Aldous Huxley writes, "may be found among the traditional lore of peoples in every region of the world, and in its fully developed forms it has a place in every one of the higher religions."\n\nWith great wit and stunning intellect—drawing on a diverse array of faiths, including Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Christian mysticism, and Islam—Huxley examines the spiritual beliefs of various religious traditions and explains how they are united by a common human yearning to experience the divine. The Perennial Philosophy includes selections from Meister Eckhart, Rumi, and Lao Tzu, as well as the Bhagavad Gita, Tibetan Book of the Dead, Diamond Sutra, and Upanishads, among many others.`,

Binder of Demons, Lord of Light.\n\nHis followers called him Mahasamatman and said he was a god. He preferred to drop the Maha- and the -atman, however, and called himself Sam. He never claimed to be a god, but then he never claimed not to be a god.\n\nA holy war rages across the heavens and mankind’s fate hangs in the balance.`,

    author: 'Roger Zelazny',
    year: '2003',
    description: `The Last Defender of Camelot is a collection of breathtaking stories that showcase the incredible abilities of the author. Edited and with an introduction by award-winning author Robert Silverberg, it includes such tales as For a Breath I Tarry, and Halfjack. It also features the Hugo Award-winning 24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai, Permafrost, and Home is the Hangman.\n\nThough SF "master of prose technique" and "paragon of the storytelling art" (in the introductory words of Robert Silverberg, himself a certified luminary) Roger Zelazny died in 1995, collections of his work appear on shelves with pleasing regularity. The Last Defender of Camelot, the fifth in the series of new Zelazny editions, offers readers 11 of what Silverberg has deemed his best stories, including "24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai," which earned him one of his six Hugos, and 1992's "Come Back to the Killing Ground, Alice, My Love," which has not been previously collected.`,
